\section{Documentation and Metadata}\label{ssc:Doku+Metadata}

Metadata are data about data. Metadata describe data in more detail. A pressure value without any context has no meaning; it requires information about the system (e.g. which fluid), the location, the pressure sensor (company and model), the used measurement device, etc.

Data documentation and the generation of metadata is essential to understand your data in detail, and also helps other researchers find, use and properly cite your data. With this, data are understandable and reusable, important for FAIR data requirements (see chapter \ref{ssc:FAIR-Data}).

Various and particular metadata standards are available. Every discipline has own domain specific schemas and you have to ask for or find them by yourself. If there are no schema for your domain or application, you may develop your own metadata schema. Further general guidelines are provided below.



\subsection{Important things to do while you collect or create your data}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Make a note of all file names and formats associated with the project,
        how the data is organized, how the data was generated (including any
        equipment or software used), and information about how the data has been
        altered or processed.
  \item Note version and producer of measurement devices and computer programs (also of the control programs of measurement devices).
  \item Include an explanation of codes, abbreviations, or variables used in the
        data or in the file naming structure.

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Documentation of general data in the DataCite-Schema}\label{sc:data-documentation}

\end{wrapfigure}
The used metadata scheme follows the recommendation of the world wide DataCite
consortium (TIB Hannover, Britisch Library, Denmark Technical Information
Center, ETH Zurich, CalTech, Australian National Data Service, ...). These data
are stored in a `readme.json' file in \textbf{\underline{EVERY DIRECTORY}} of
your data! Please, use our `Readme File Creator' described below to generate
this file.\\
Explanation of some extracted properties are given in the following; please
refer to Table 3 in \cite{datacite2019} for more information: \\[6pt]
%
\textbf{ID 1: Identifier} \\
Number used to identify the data. Can be a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) in
case of a paper, or an ID from the ELN (eLabFTW generates a long number for
every experiment, see below) \\[6pt]
%
\textbf{ID 2: Creator} \\
Name of the person responsible for the described data (ORCID). \\[6pt]
%
\textbf{ID 3: Title} \\
May be the title of a dataset, or the name of a piece of software, or the
title of a paper. \\[6pt]
%
\textbf{ID 4: Publisher} \\
The name of the entity that produces, holds, archives, publishes prints,
distributes, releases or issues the resource (e.g. `Leibniz Institute for
Materials Engineering IWT'). \\[6pt]
%
\textbf{ID 5: Publication Year} \\
The year when the data was or will be made publicly available. \\[6pt]
%
\textbf{ID 8: Date} \\
Key date associated with the data, e.g. project start, end date, data
modification, data release date, or time period covered by the data \\[6pt]
%
\textbf{ID 9: Language} \\
Language(s) of the intellectual content of the resource, when applicable \\[6pt]
%
\textbf{ID 10: Resource Type} \\
A description of the resource; mostly ‘DataSet’, but may be ‘Audiovisual’,
‘High-Speed Images’, ‘DataPaper’, etc. \\[6pt]
%
\textbf{ID 19: Funding Reference} \\
Organizations or agencies who funded the research \\[6pt]
%
\textbf{ID 16: Rights} \\
Any known intellectual property rights held for the data. The best choice is
either the Creative Commons license 'CC-BY' (BY attribution) or 'CC-0' for
data and 'CC Version 4.0' for written documents. \\[6pt]
%
\textbf{ID 17: Description} \\
How the data was generated, including equipment or software used, experimental
protocol, other things you might include in a lab notebook \\[6pt]
%
\textbf{ID 18: Geolocation} \\
When the data relates to a physical location, record information about its
spatial coverage \\[6pt]

This tool displayed in figure \ref{fig:readme-creator} can be downloaded from the IWT-File-Server ($\rightarrow$Austausch $\rightarrow$Forschungs\-datenmanagement $\rightarrow$DataManagementGuidelines-ServiceFiles $\rightarrow$ReadmeFileCreator) for every operating system to simplify metadata entry (figure on the right). You can create automatically a file called ‘readme.json’ with your metadata, embedded in a JSON (Java Scipt Object Notation) format, which is used as documentation as well as metadata for Data Science Methods. This file is stored in every directory which contains data or program code. Field entries can be empty if they are not applicable. \\

The same DataCite metadata structure can be included into the ELN (see chapter \ref{ssc:ELN}).



\subsection{Generation of a metadata scheme}
A schema is a logical plan showing the relationships between metadata elements,
normally through establishing rules for the use and management of metadata. An example of the development of a metadata schema is given in the paper of Eberskirch et al. \cite{elberskirch:2022}. There, all relevant parameters are collected to describe nanoparticles physically as well as biologically (toxicologically) in a comprehensive manner which yield a metadata scheme.
The development of suitable scheme for your specific domain can be helpful for structuring your data as well as your knowledge.
