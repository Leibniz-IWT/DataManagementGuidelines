\section{EndNote}

We have EndNote as literature management software for everyone (single user
system). EndNote can be integrated into Word to manage cited references in
publications. It also serves as a literature database for papers, textbooks,
presentations etc. And it is used as the literature database for all
publications from the L-IWT.
